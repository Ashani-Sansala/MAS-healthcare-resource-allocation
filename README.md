# Hospital Resource Allocation Simulation (Using Multi-Agent System)

This project is a multi-agent simulation system built using the Mesa framework. It models hospital resource allocation to patients based on their medical needs and hospital resource capacity.

## Features

### ü§ñ Agent Types
- ResourceCoordinatorAgent
    - Central agent managing resource allocation.
    - Develops allocation strategies considering patient severity, hospital capacity, and resource efficiency.
    - Negotiates resource allocation by evaluating hospital bids for patients.
    - Coordinates global resource transfers for load balancing.

- HospitalAgent
    - Represents hospitals with specific specializations and resources.
    - Evaluates patients for admission using a score based on specialization match and resource efficiency.
    - Allocates resources to patients and manages internal resource replenishment.
 
- PatientAgent
    - Represents patients with dynamic medical needs based on severity (low, medium, high).
    - Generates medical needs stochastically.
    - Sends messages to the ResourceCoordinatorAgent to request resources.
 
### üñºÔ∏è Visualization
- Hospitals are represented as blue circles, with size indicating available resources.
- Patients are represented as red circles, with size indicating the severity of their medical needs.
- Includes real-time charts and message logs for monitoring the simulation.

### üìà Performance Monitoring
- Resource Allocation Efficiency Chart: Tracks how effectively resources are allocated.
- Total Unmet Needs Chart: Displays the total unmet needs of patients over time.
